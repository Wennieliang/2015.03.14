 people thinks  developed countries should fund poor countries as to improve their people's health condition, education and trade. What is your opinion?

 developed countries  formed comprehensive systems in  fields, but the developing countries did not have relevant systems as developed contries. I think the developed countries should assist developing countries in the building of infrastructure, because developed countries have responsibility to help the undevelped countries. 

the developed countries should fulfill duty to help the poor countries .  developed countries have taken a lot of resources from the poor countries in old days, so after the advanced countries have made enough money to deal with their domestic requirements. They have the sense of responsibility to assist developing countries to solve their  domestic requirements, such as lacking money in educating and lacking doctors in curing. After developed countries do their job, those countries can be called the real developed countries.

the developed countries a have advanced technology in medication. For example, developing countries spend most of their money in developing economy, so they usually pay less attention on health system, this actin leads to  people die in illness and lacks enough medical technology in curing patients. On the contrary, in the developed countries, fewer people die in normal sickness, because they have spent a huge amount of expenditure in medical system which can help them to treat the sick successfully. So, the developed countries should share that technology to the developing countries, helping developing countries to decrease the death rate.

To sum up, the developed countries should take up their duty to assist the developing countries in infrastructure.
